# Pipeline and Application
Useful scripts is a project (which I will rename at some point) to begin the process of automating my developer workflow. I have spent many years studying computer science theory while I was ill. Now that my health is returning I have many ideas. And I need to spend time applying the basics as I work the complexity and richness in the code. One step with every commit.
